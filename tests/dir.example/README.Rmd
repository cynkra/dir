# dir.example

'dir.example' shows how the ['dir'](https://github.com/cynkra/dir) package works.

Look at the code and you'll see we have some code in the R folder but also in 2
other folders named "greetings" and "math", where we have another nested folder.

To set up this project to use dir we used the following command:

```r
dir::use_dir_package("greetings", "math", "inst/not_build_ignored", "R/r_subfolder", patch = TRUE)
```

We see that :

* The R files are properly sourced from everywhere
* The doc is properly knitted
* The file "math/_sandbox.R" is ignored due to the "_" prefix (files starting with "." are ignored too)
* The script "inst/not_build_ignored/answer.R" is not build ignored since (we don't build ignore code stored under "inst")
* `devtools::check()` passes
* `devtools::test()` passes
* The package doesn't depend on {dir} (not even suggested)

## Installation

Install with:

```r
pak::pak("cynkra/dir/inst/dir.example")
```
