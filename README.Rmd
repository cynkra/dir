{dir} allows you to store your code in a nested folder structure, rather than
 solely in the "R" folder.
 
Set it up with one line of boiler plate code as explained in the setup section, from there on calling `devtools::load_all()` will:

* Load the code from the R folder AND your added folders (recursively into nested folders by default)
* `document()` everything, so no need to call `devtools::document()` (In fact calling
  the latter will undocument some objects, an unfortunate side effect of the magic we use)
 
Files and folders starting with "_" or "." in your added folders will be ignored by the process.

{dir} won't be needed by the end users of your package, and yes your package is CRAN compliant.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
pak::pak("cynkra/dir")
```

## Setup

To set this up, you need to trigger a call to `dir::add()` for developers only.
There are 2 ways to do it, through `.onLoad()` or through a local ".RProfile".

To do so you might for instance have in your "zzz.R" file:

```r
.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {
  if (Sys.getenv("DEVTOOLS_LOAD") == pkgname) dir::add("new_top_level_folder", "maybe_another_one")
}
```

Or have this line in your local ".RProfile" (`usethis::edit_r_profile("project")`) 

```r
setHook(packageEvent("your.package.name", "onLoad"), function(...) dir::add("new_top_level_folder", "maybe_another_one"))
```

## How does it work?

`dir::add()` will:

* Add the 'dir' package to your "Suggests" dependencies in the "DESCRIPTION" file.
* Add your added folders to ".Rbuidignore"
* Load the code from your added folders into the `sysdata.rda` file in the R folder.
* Load the objects into the session
* Document everything, like `devtools::document()`

## Do you have an example ?

Sure, [there you go!](https://github.com/cynkra/dir.example)

## Minor annoyances

* `devtools::document()` won't work as intended, it will mess with your doc and NAMESPACE file,
but you don't need it, use only `load_all()`. If you call it by mistake `load_all()` will repair the mess.
* `devtools::check()` runs `document()` at the end of the checks, that messes with the
doc and the NAMESPACE file as well. The check itself is not affected though, here
as well `load_all()` will clean up the mess.

## History
 
This had been 
[raised](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2009-December/056022.html) 
[on](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2010-February/056513.html)
[r-devel](https://hypatia.math.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2023-March/082496.html) 
multiple times but little interest has been shown to implement the feature,
so here we are.
